This Weaviate workflow uses the summarise ‚ú® function by to speed up studying a companyüìö

- It takes in an url,
- Gets the complete website structure and stores the main content of each page into a networkx graph.
- This graph is then exported to a json file that is then uploaded to your local Weaviate instance.
- A GraphQL query is written that asks Weaviate to summarise the page content, which is then outputted into a new json and merged into the original graph.
- The graph is then reconverted into a mdbook to enable you to quickly develop a broad understanding of a company.

The summarised webpages are visualized in a tree structure in your self-hosted mdbook websiteüåê.

## Demo

The video below shows how the Weaviate.io website overview can be seen, while quick scoping the page summaries.

## Usage

To use this code, install the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md), and run [this](Summarise_website_with_weaviate.ipynb) Jupiter Notebook. Afterwards, you can show your website as summarised by Weaviate with:

```sh
mdbook build &&  mdbook serve
```

(Ps. You can also run `python -m src.pythontemplate` if you prefer CLI over ipynb).


## How can this be made more awesome?üöÄ
- Include CI pipeline to (show people how to run it a-z with 1 command on their own device).
- Include support for Mac & Windows.
- Present as a service.
- Allow the user to navigate the tree by folding/unfolding into deeper levels
- limit the number of children to 5 and a `...<unfold>` child.
- (Optional) use color schemes to separate different branches.
- Include the link to the original page and give option to show the main, unsummarised text.
- Include number of links to- & from page, and visualize it in edge thickness.
- Most of the time, it is not just the raw data you want from a company website but the secondary (or ternary) insights gained in processing that data and/or combining it with other relevant or recent developments. This is where Weaviate may shine, as it supports enhancing your own databases in combination with LLMs. A guided structure may be set up to facilitate this.
