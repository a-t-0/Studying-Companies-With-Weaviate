Weaviate Cloud has short-term, sandbox clusters and permanent, serverless clusters. To create a cluster, click the 'Create cluster' button on the WCD Dashboard page. The sandbox is free for 14 days, the sandbox expires and all data is deleted. To retrieve a copy of your sandbox data before it is deleted, use the cursor API.
