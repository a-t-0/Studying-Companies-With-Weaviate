We are going to use a movie dataset sourced from TMDB. The dataset can be found in this GitHub repository. It contains bibliographic information on ~700 movies released between 1990 and 2024. You will need an OpenAI API key to follow along. If you have any questions or feedback, let us know in the user forum.
