We'll use data from a popular quiz game show called Jeopardy!. The original dataset can be found here on Kaggle, but we'll use a small subset from it, just containing 100 rows. The name refers to each row or item (note: singular), so I called itJeopardyQuestion. Then, I need to define properties and types.
