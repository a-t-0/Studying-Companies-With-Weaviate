The vector index is a key component of Weaviate's search capabilities. It allows you to search for vectors based on their similarity to a query vector. Each index is configurable, allowing you to tune its performance to your specific use case. This course is self-contained. We recommend that you go through one of the 101-level courses, such as that for working with text.
