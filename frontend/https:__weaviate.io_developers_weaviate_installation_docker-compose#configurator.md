The default docker image doesn't need any configuration. To customize your instance, edit the configuration settings in the docker-compose.yml file. Use the Configurator to select specific Weaviate modules, including vectorizers that run locally. You can use environment variables to control your Weaviates setup, authentication and authorization.
