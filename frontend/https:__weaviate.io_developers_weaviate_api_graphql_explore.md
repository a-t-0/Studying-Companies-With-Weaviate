Use Explore to perform vector searches across multiple collections. The Explore function is disabled where multiple inference (e.g. text2vec-xxx) modules are enabled. Explore is not available on Weaviate Cloud as its clusters are pre-configured with multiple inference modules for AWS, Cohere, Google, OpenAI and so on.
