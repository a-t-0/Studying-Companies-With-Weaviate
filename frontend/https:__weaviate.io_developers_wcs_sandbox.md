Weaviate Cloud (WCD) provides two instance types. Sandbox clusters run a full version of the Weaviate core database. Sandboxes are fully featured, but they have a limited lifetime and they run on scaled down infrastructure compared to serverless clusters. If you are working through a course in Weaviates Academy, consider using a sandbox to complete the lessons.
