Weaviate scales well for large projects. Smaller projects, less than 1M objects, do not require resource planning. For medium and large-scale projects, you should plan how to get the best performance from your resources. CPU and memory are the primary resources for Weaviate instances. Depending on the modules you use, GPUs may also play a role.
