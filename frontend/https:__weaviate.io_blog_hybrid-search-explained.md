The Hybrid search feature was introduced in Weaviate 1.17. It uses sparse and dense vectors to represent the semantic meaning and context of search queries and documents. Sparse vectors have mostly zero values with only a few non-zero values. Dense embeddings are generated from algorithms like BM25 and SPLADE.
