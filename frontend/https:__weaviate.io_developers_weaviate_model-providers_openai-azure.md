Weaviate seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Azure's APIs, allowing users to leverage OpenAI's models directly within the Weaviate database. These integrations empower developers to build sophisticated AI-driven applications with ease. The model provider integration pages are new and still undergoing improvements. We appreciate any feedback on this forum thread.
