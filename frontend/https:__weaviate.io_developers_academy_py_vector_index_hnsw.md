HNSW, or "Hierarchical Navigable Small World", is a powerful and flexible vector index type. It allows for fast and accurate searches of high-dimensional vectors. It also has the advantage of being very scalable, while being tunable to allow for different trade-offs between search speed, accuracy, and resource requirements.
