Weaviate Cloud (WCD) hosts clusters that run the Weaviate core database server. WCD runs the current production version of Weaviates core. W CD does not automatically update clusters, however if an existing cluster has a security vulnerability, WCD upgrades the cluster when a fix is released. The WCD console informs you when a newer version is available. Consider your business needs and upgrade your cluster when you have a suitable maintenance window.
