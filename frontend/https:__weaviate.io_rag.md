Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve the accuracy of AI-generated content. Weaviate's design caters specifically to the demands of vector data, enabling unparalleled scalability and performance. This scalability is key in RAG applications, where the volume of data and the need for rapid retrieval is significant.
