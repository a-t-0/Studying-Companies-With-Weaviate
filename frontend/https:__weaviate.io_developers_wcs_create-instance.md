Weaviate Cloud (WCD) provides two instance types. To create a cluster, click the 'Create cluster' button on the WCD Dashboard page. By default, API keys are enabled for all WCD clusters. Serverless clusters have an administrator key and a read-only key. Sandbox clusters only have a administrator key.
