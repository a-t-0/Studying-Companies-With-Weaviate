A 'grouped task' generation wil perform RAG queries on a set of retrieved objects. This is useful when you want to transform the set of objects as a whole, with one prompt. You can also pass on a list of properties to be used, as the grouped_properties parameter. This can be useful to reduce the amount of data passed on.
