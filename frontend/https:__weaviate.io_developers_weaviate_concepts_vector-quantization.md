Vector quantization reduces the memory footprint of the vector index by compressing the vector embeddings. Weaviate currently offers two vector quantization techniques:Product quantization is a multi-step quantization technique that is available for use with hnsw indexes in Weaivate. In neural networks, quantification reduces the values of the weights or activations of the model stored as a 32-bit floating-point number (4 bytes) to a lower precision number, such as an 8-bit integer.
