A 'grouped task' generation wil perform RAG queries on a set of retrieved objects. This is useful when you want to transform the set of objects as a whole, with one prompt. For grouped_task queries, you simply pass on the prompt to the grouped\_ task parameter. You can also pass on a list of properties to be used. This can be useful to reduce the amount of data passed on.
