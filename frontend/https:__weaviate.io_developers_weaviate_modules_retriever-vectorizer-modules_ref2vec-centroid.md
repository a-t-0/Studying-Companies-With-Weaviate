The ref2Vec-centroid module is used to calculate object vectors based on the centroid of referenced vectors. The idea is that this centroid vector would be calculated from the vectors of an object's references, enabling associations between clusters of objects. This is useful in applications such as making suggestionsbased on the aggregation of a user's actions or preferences.
