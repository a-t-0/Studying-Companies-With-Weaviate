Use the after operator to retrieve all objects from a Weaviate instance. The after operator retrieves objects of a class based on the order of ids. You can pass the id of the last retrieved object as a cursor to start the next page. The offset parameter is a flexible way to page results as it allows use with parameters like sort.
