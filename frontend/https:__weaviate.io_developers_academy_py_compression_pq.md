Product quantization (PQ), is a technique used to compress vectors. In Weaviate, it can be used to reduce the size of the in-memory HNSW index. PQ can improve performance and reduce resource requirements as well as costs. It can reduce the length of the vector by a factor of 6, and also thesize of each segment from a floating point number (4 bytes) to a byte.
