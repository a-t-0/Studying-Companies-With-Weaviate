RAG is the process of augmenting inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM) with context retrieved from a vector database. RAG applications are commonly used for chatbots and question-answering systems. The RAG pipeline is broken down into three components: 1. Indexing, 2. Retrieval, and 3. Generation.
