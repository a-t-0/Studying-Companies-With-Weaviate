Weaviate's integration with OpenAI's APIs allows you to access their models' capabilities directly from Weaviate. The model provider integration pages are new and still undergoing improvements. The integration is enabled by default on Weaviated Cloud (WCD) serverless instances. You must provide a valid OpenAI API key to Weaviates for this integration.
