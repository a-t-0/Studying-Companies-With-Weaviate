You can also perform keyword (BM25) searches to find items based on their keyword similarity, or hybrid searches that combine BM25 and semantic/ vector searches. The limit parameter here sets the maximum number of results to return. The return_metadata parameter takes an instance of the MetadataQuery class to set metadata to return in the search results.
