Weaviate integrates with OctoAI's embedding models to enable seamless vectorization of data. This integration allows users to perform semantic and hybrid search operations without the need for additional preprocessing or data transformation steps. The model provider integration pages are new and still undergoing improvements. We appreciate any feedback on this forum thread.
