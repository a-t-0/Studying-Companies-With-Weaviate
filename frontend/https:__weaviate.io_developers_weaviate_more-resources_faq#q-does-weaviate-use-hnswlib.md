Weaviate is a search engine that uses inverted indices to store data and values. Data is stored as vectors, which enables semantic search. This combination of data storage is unique, and enables fast, filtered and semantic search from end-to-end. Weaviate comes containerized to make it easier for others to build their own systems.
