A new paper from Tencent and Carnegie Mellon asked:. What text chunk size should we use in our RAG workflows? How does chunk size impact retrieval recall? Are bigger chunks better? Smaller chunks but keep more top-k? They found that instead of using 100-word passage or sentence-level chunking it's best create Propositions - concise, distinct and self-contained expressions of factoids.
