Weaviate's integration with Voyage AI's APIs allows you to access their models' capabilities directly from Weaviate. The integration is enabled by default on Weaviates Cloud (WCD) serverless instances. The model provider integration pages are new and still undergoing improvements. We appreciate any feedback on this forum thread.
