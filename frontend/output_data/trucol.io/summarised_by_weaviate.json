The protocol is set up in such a way that if you solve the problem by completing the contract, you become the target of the contract and the contract is fulfilled.\nYes! As the contracts are open source you can simply run the available code to verify your code locally before pushing your solution to the blockchain.\nThe costs of the contract depend on what the contract does. A minimum of approximately $50,- can currently be expected. We expect that the contract costs will go down in the future with ETH 2.0 thanks to staking and/or sharding. Furthermore, to reduce evaluation costs, one could opt to sacrifice some decentralisation through the use of an oracle service with (decentralised) CIs.\nSelect one of your tasks that can be verified objectively by a computer and determine how much you are willing spend on the solution.

Setting out bounties would provide a great solution for this. However, existing systems require an often costly middleperson and a modicum of trust between all parties. This is why we set out to develop a decentralized, trust-less collaboration platform and protocol for test-driven programming development.
