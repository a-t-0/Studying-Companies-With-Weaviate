vector search is the most robust and versatile search type. It is well-suited for situations where the meaning, or the vector representation, is of the highest importance. Keyword search is useful when there is an expectation or requirement to match the exact search terms. This can be the case for specific domains such as legal, medical or technical areas where the exact terminology is important.
