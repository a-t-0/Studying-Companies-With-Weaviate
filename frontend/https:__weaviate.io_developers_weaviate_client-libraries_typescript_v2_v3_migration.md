The Weaviate TypeScript client supports TypeScript and JavaScript. The v3 client supports server side development (Node.js hosted). See v3 packages for details. If your application is browser based, consider using the TypeScript clients v2 and v3. The default gRPC port is 50051. To map the Weaviates gR PC port in your Docker container to a local port, add this code to your docker-compose.yml file.
