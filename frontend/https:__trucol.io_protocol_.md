TruCol is a smart contract with a bounty for deterministically verifiable development tasks. Developers from all over the world are able to complete these tasks and get rewarded automatically when the requirement of the smart contract is fulfilled. The protocol thus removes the middleman and costly fees, and stimulates an open and fair development market.
