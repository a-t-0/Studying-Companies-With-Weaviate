I heard of Weaviate through a video by the Youtuber Fireship. I have since used it whenever I needed a vector database for one of my side projects. Philip invited me to intern in his team after seeing our Hackathon project. I didnâ€™t hesitate long to take one semester off from my computer science bachelor.
