Weaviate collections support multiple, named vectors. Each vector space has its own index, its own compression, and its own vectorizer. This section describes Weaviate's individual modules, including their capabilities and how to use them. Modules can be " vectorizers" (defines how the numbers in the vectors are chosen from the data) or other modules providing additional functions.
